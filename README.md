Cochlear Modelling Jupyter Notebooks

These are developed by [Andre van Schaik](https://westernsydney.edu.au/bens) based on Dick Lyons' book [Human and Machine Hearing](http://www.machinehearing.org).

Start with Cochlea.ipynb, then CAR.ipynb, followed by CARFAC.ipynb and IHC.ipynb, and finally CARFACAGC.ipynb.
